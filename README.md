Bossrush is an endless roguelike colosseum game where the player faces increasingly powerful enemies in a single, unforgiving arena.
Each run is a test of survival, strategy, and adaptability as waves escalate without a final victory condition.

Combat is turn-based and focused on resource management, positioning, and skill timing. Defeated enemies strengthen future encounters,
forcing the player to continually refine their build or fall to the arena.

The game is designed to be lightweight, fast to iterate on, and fully playable in the terminal using ncurses.
